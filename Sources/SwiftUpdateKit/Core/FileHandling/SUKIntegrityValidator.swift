/// A utility class for validating the integrity of files used within the ``SwiftUpdateKit`` framework.

/// both in terms of structure and integrity. This includes verifying checksums, file types, and ensuring that
/// files meet specified conditions required for the successful operation of updates and installations within the framework.
///
/// This class is a core part of the file handling system, ensuring that files are correctly verified before
/// any updates, installations, or manipulations occur. It plays a critical role in avoiding errors that might
/// arise from corrupted, incomplete, or incompatible files.
