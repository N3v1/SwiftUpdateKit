# Swift Update Kit (SUK)

SUK is a lightweight, customizable, and powerful framework designed to handle software updates effortlessly. It prioritizes simplicity in setup while offering advanced capabilities like delta updates, custom release providers, lifecycle hooks, and more. SUK is ideal for developers seeking an alternative to more intensive frameworks like Sparkle.

> [!NOTE]
> SwiftUpdateKit is currently in development and not yet ready for production use. You are welcome to use the [latest alpha/dev build](https://github.com/N3v1/SwiftUpdateKit/releases/latest) at your own risk. We welcome feedback [here](https://github.com/N3v1/SwiftUpdateKit/issues).

### Features

- **Automatic Update Checks:** Fetch and parse release feeds with minimal setup.
- **Customizable Channels:** Support for stable, beta, alpha, and custom release channels.
- **Delta Updates:** Download only the parts of the software that have changed.
- **Lifecycle Hooks:** Add custom logic during update events (e.g., pre-installation, post-installation).
- **Error Reporting:** Built-in API to handle and report errors gracefully.
- **Code-Signing Validation:** Ensure the integrity and authenticity of updates.
- **Custom Release Providers:** Integrate with GitHub, custom servers, or other release feeds.
- **User-Friendly Update Notifications:** Notify users about updates in a clear, non-intrusive way.
